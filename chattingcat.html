				<p class="content">My work mainly consisted of solving three issues found in both of ChattingCat's website and app. I took on the challenges of how the format only had a single chunky page which was too complex to scale properly, how to effectively create ways for writers and editors to communicate with each other and how to improve proofreading quality and reliability.

				<p class="content">ChattingCat started its service with a single web page where writers could request proofreading and a confirmation revision from the editors. However, we kept adding more features to it, which led to one complex chunky page containing all the features that ChattingCat offers. Some important features were overshadowed by other features to the point that it was not providing a good user experience.

Deleted text are now crossed out in red while the added text are wrapped in a mint color box. This method helps writers to recognize the revisions to their original writing better. I also changed the typeface of the text to Serif for better readability.</p>
