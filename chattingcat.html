				<p style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 22px">ChattingCat is a platform that connects people who want someone to check their English writing with people who want to help. Through the ChattingCat website or app, writers can conveniently get instant corrections of their work.

				As the sole designer, I worked hands-on with users on user experience as well as being involved in strategic product decisions. I also developed all of ChattingCat's web pages using AngularJS.
